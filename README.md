Original Readme: 
"To use, create a folder called "io_scene_bz2msh" in your blender addons folder. Extract the files into the new folder, open blender, and activate the addon in preferences. Search for "BZ2 MSH Format" in addons.

The menu option under file -> import will then be available.


Import logic for local mesh & material imports fixed by ZerothDivision and tested by GrizzlyOne95"
